Step 1 :-  Generate an SSH Key Pair 

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

Step 2 :-  
When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," you can press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).
You will then be asked to enter a passphrase. This is optional but recommended for added security.

Step 3 :- 

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where your SSH keys are stored. This is usually C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh\.

ex :- cd C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh\

Step 4 :- 

Use the following command to display the contents of the id_rsa.pub file:

type id_rsa.pub

Step 5 :- 
Copy the Public Key:

Copy the entire output of the command. This is your public key, and you need to add it to your GitLab account

Add the Public Key to GitLab:

Log in to your GitLab account.
Navigate to "Edit Profile" and then Click on "SSH Keys."
Paste the copied public key into the "Key" field.
Add a title for the key and click "Add key."
